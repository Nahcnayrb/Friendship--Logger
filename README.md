# My Personal Project

## Friendship Logger

This application enables the user to add a friend to a 
friends list where the user can essentially **create a mini profile about that friend** by **inputting personal information** such as
their *birthdays* and *interests*, or document future plans they have with that friend. These kinds of information **can constantly be added or modified** which would be helpful
in instances where the user learns new information about that friend as they get to know them better or modify a friend's interests if they
 aren't as interested in something they were passionate about before.

This application is ideal for users who are often 
forgetful of minor yet important details about others. 
This project interests me because like many 
others, I am an extremely forgetful person when 
it comes to remembering things about people. For example, I might forget about a friend's 
birthday, and am too embarassed to have the awkward chat about when their birthday is after knowing them for five whole years.
Therefore, having an application like this is useful in which I can document the plans I have made with friends and traits about them that I learned through interactions with them.
 As time goes on, I can then use the application to quickly bring up useful summaries such as displaying the common interests between my friend and I, 
displaying which friend in the friends list has the next birthday, or displaying the plans I have in the future with each friend. These kinds of summaries would be 
helpful especially in situations where I'm planning for birthday gifts in advance, organizing my schedule, or
 brainstorming some conversation ideas that I can use when I'm about to interact with them after a long time.
